Info:
- path is one location to another
- route is all the paths to go by every location

procedure ACO_MetaHeuristic is
while run do
    generateSolutions()  --> ants go on some route
    daemonActions()      --> optional (won't need for this)
    pheromoneUpdate()    --> do the pheromone update (evaporation)
repeat
end procedure


Pheromone update (evaporation):
p = pheromone evaporation constant
t = pheromone on path from before ants
f = updated pheromone on path

f = (1 - p)t + pheromone on path that ants just dropped


Pheromone left behind on each path visited:
l = length of the ants route
pheromone left behind on each path = 1 / l


Probability of choosing certain path:
p = probability of going on the path
t = total pheromones on path
n = 1/cost (length) of path
a and b are constants -- a values high pheromone levels and b values short paths
total = the total of the equation (t^a * n^b) for all possible paths the ant could go on

p = (t^a * n^b) / total


Notes:
- need a matrix for all the paths (costs (length), pheromones)
